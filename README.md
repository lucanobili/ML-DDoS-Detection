## Machine Learning applied to DDoS attacks detection and characterization

I built a machine learning pipeline in Python, starting with data preprocessing and exploration. I applied supervised learning for DDoS attack classification and used unsupervised learning for clustering similar attack types. Finally, I analyzed the clusters to gain insights into attack patterns.

## Features
The project submission is in the file "ML4N_project5_DDoS attacks.pdf" and the report is in the file "ML_project.pdf".
